# tesla-pwa
Simple PWA for basic control of a Tesla vehicle

Goals:
 - Quickly enable climate control in my Model 3 (no waiting for wake up in the app)
 - Play with moden web tech (ServiceWorker, etc.)
 - Entirely stand-alone. As an engineer on the web platform team at Google, I want to experience the pain of building directly for the web without any framework or 3p library
 - Trustworthy - secure, transparent code, no personal data or credentials shared with me. Easily clonable if others want to deploy an instance they have complete control over.
 - Works only in modern evergreen browsers (chromium, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
